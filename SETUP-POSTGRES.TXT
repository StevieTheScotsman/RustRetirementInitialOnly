i followed this guid on digitalocean https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart and it just worked on work linux laptop.

i did uninstall postrges first then reinstall it though.

on that box we have postgres db user shona with her password (same as nc) and by default will connect to db shona by default

my understanding is that this is ident authentiation type in postgres ...still to try using pgadmin4
